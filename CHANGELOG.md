# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `plugins/phd-research/skills/rebuttal-drafter/`: point-by-point
  reviewer response package based on handbook §3.5 Paper Revision
  LaTeX template. Emits a `response/r1.tex`, `r2.tex`, `r3.tex` layout
  wired into `main.tex`, plus an author-internal `meta.tex` planning
  file, using the handbook's `\revision{<text>}` markup for conference
  rebuttal rounds and AC meta-response. The skill set now has eight
  anchor skills.

### Fixed

- Restored `## Integrity gate` sections in six SKILL.md files
  (`intro-drafter`, `pre-submission-reviewer`, `figure-designer`,
  `idea-evaluator`, `tech-paper-template`, `vibe-research-workflow`)
  byte-for-byte from commit `6527860~1`; forward references from each
  Step body now resolve.
- Removed orphan closing triple-backtick at EOF of those six files.
- Neutralised eleven references to the nonexistent
  `disruptive-innovation-scout` skill by redirecting to
  `handbook/02_Idea_Generation/2.3`.
- Corrected three stale `../../1_Guide/...` hyperlinks in
  `handbook/03_Paper_Writing/3.2` to use relative `../06_Case_Studies/`.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-04-20

Curriculum re-sync per upstream methodology author. The `handbook/` tree
is re-aligned with the current `HKUSTDial/PhD.Skills/1_Guide/` master,
which had drifted since v2.0.0 (new passages, new figures, renamed PDF).

### Changed

- All 18 handbook MD files re-synced verbatim from upstream. The only
  local edit is an image-path rewrite `../../images/` ->
  `../../assets/images/` to preserve the Supervisor `assets/` layout;
  chapter-local refs (`./assets/5.1_vibe_research/...`,
  `./assets/5.2_meeting_notes/...`) remain as upstream.
- Companion PDF renamed
  `handbook/01_Preliminary/博士生科研入门辅导_2023年8月.pdf` ->
  `博士生科研入门辅导.pdf` to match upstream. All references in
  `README.md` and `README.en.md` updated.
- `assets/images/intro_flowchart_board.png` updated to the current
  upstream revision.

### Added

- 10 image assets under `assets/images/`: `aflow_existing_vs_ours.png`,
  `alpha_sql_solution_overview.png`, `dense_body_layout_example.png`,
  `experiment_canvas_bad.png`, `experiment_canvas_good.png`,
  `lead_solution_overview.png`, `performance_teaser_example.png`, plus
  `.webp` variants for `aflow_solution_overview`,
  `intro_flowchart_alpha_sql`, `intro_flowchart`.
- 11 chapter-local assets for Chapter 5:
  `handbook/05_Vibe_Research/assets/5.1_vibe_research/image1..10.png`
  and `handbook/05_Vibe_Research/assets/5.2_meeting_notes/foundation_agents_vibe_research_overview.png`.

### Unchanged

- `plugins/phd-research/skills/` (seven anchor skills, per v2.0.0
  Guide/Skill decoupling rule).
- `docs/en/handbook/` (English mirror; content-level re-translation
  tracked separately).
- `scripts/`, `.claude-plugin/`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `LICENSE`, `llms.txt`.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-04-20

Structural reset per upstream methodology author. The human-readable
curriculum is restored to the original wording and layout from
`HKUSTDial/PhD.Skills` (master branch); the rewritten intermediate docs
shipped in v1.0.0 are removed.

### Changed

- `README.md` reverted to the master-branch narrative of PhD.Skills, with
  a project logo added and the file tree updated to reflect the new
  Supervisor-Skills layout.
- Chinese curriculum promoted from `archive/v1-source/1_Guide/` to the
  top-level `handbook/` directory, preserved verbatim.
- English curriculum re-translated from the restored Chinese handbook
  into `docs/en/handbook/`, replacing the v1.0.0 English overviews.
- License changed from CC BY 4.0 to **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0** to match the
  upstream methodology.

### Removed

- `docs/zh/foundations/`, `docs/zh/skills/*/overview.md`,
  `docs/zh/case-studies/`, `docs/zh/README.md` (intermediate Chinese
  documentation rewritten by the v1.0.0 maintainers).
- `docs/en/foundations/`, `docs/en/skills/*/overview.md`,
  `docs/en/case-studies/`, `docs/en/README.md` (English mirror of the
  removed Chinese docs).
- `archive/v1-source/` (content promoted to `handbook/` or obsolete).
- `README.en.md` v1.0.0 version (replaced by a new English mirror of the
  restored root README).

### Unchanged

- `plugins/phd-research/skills/` (seven anchor skills and their
  `references/`, `SKILL.md`, `HOW-TO-USE.md`).
- `scripts/lint_skills.py`.
- `.claude-plugin/` manifests.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-19
