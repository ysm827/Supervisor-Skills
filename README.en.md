# Supervisor-Skills: Ten years of PhD-advisor research experience, distilled into your AI co-advisor.

> From idea conception to paper submission, covering the full research lifecycle.

English · [中文](README.md)

## Why this project?

Hi, I'm [Yuyu Luo](https://luoyuyu.vip/), Assistant Professor at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou). From my own PhD journey to mentoring students, I keep seeing the same scene: talented graduate students, as they step into research, are trapped by very similar struggles:

*   **Theory-practice gap**: After reading countless "research primers", when it is time to tackle one's own topic, one still does not know how to start.
*   **Scarce mentoring bandwidth**: The advisor is busy, and cannot give timely, careful feedback on every idea that pops up.
*   **Pre-submission fog**: The paper is drafted, yet it is unclear whether the logic is tight, whether the figures meet top-venue aesthetics, or whether a "rookie mistake" is hiding in the text.
*   **The "capability gap" in the AI era**: Large models are powerful, but without judgement and academic taste, AI is just a "high-end toy". **Relying solely on "prompting" cannot produce outstanding research.**

Together, these challenges form the **"Last-Mile Problem" of research**. It is about more than method — it is about experience, taste, and confidence.

That is why I started this project. We take ten years of accumulated publishing, reviewing experience and academic intuition at top venues in data science and AI (SIGMOD, VLDB, ICML, NeurIPS), and we "distil" and "forge" them into a set of structured **AI Skills** that large language models (Claude, GPT-4, etc.) can precisely execute.

This repository is **not merely a theoretical guide**. Its core is a first attempt to turn the **tacit knowledge** that sits in the minds of top researchers, but is difficult to articulate, into **directly-callable productivity**.

Our vision is simple: **Let AI become your true, always-on research co-advisor.**

## Tutorial structure

The tutorial follows a dual-track architecture of **Guide (theoretical handbook) + Skills (executable AI skills)**:

### 📖 handbook: Research and writing system guide

> **📄 Companion slides**: [博士生科研入门辅导.pdf](handbook/01_Preliminary/博士生科研入门辅导.pdf) — the companion PDF to this guide, suitable for printing or reading on an iPad. It captures the complete framework for getting started in research.

This section preserves the systematic theoretical framework for deep reading and study. Only by grasping the *way* can one better use the *tools*.
